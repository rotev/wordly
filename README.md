# Welcome to Wordly

Wordly is a blogging engine that aims to make the process of building, deploying and maintaining a blog easy, fun and flexible
without compromising on user-friendless.

You might say that Wordly tries to be both developer-friendly and user-friendly.

## The "Why?"

Does the world really need another blog engine? After all, we have Wordpress, perhaps the greatest blog engine ever created.
The short answer is "Yes" (you wouldn't be here otherwise, would you?)

Not all blogs were created equal. Indeed, a lot of blog owners are not programmers and care only about easily and quickly fitting
their blog with a ready-made theme, and hosting it on a Web host of their choice. This is where Wordpress really shines
and where Wordly will never try to outshine it.

However, many times, potential blog / site owners reach out to us, the developers, to build them a custom-made blog or personal
Website, with all kinds of far-fetched requirements like 3rd-party login, Facebook and Twitter support or semantic search. This
is where Wordpress falls short, and Wordly tries to stand out. By using industry-standard, community-supported technologies Wordly
tries to make the process of modifying, customizing, extending and maintaining a blog into an easy, enjoyable and efficient experience.

## Getting Started

To get started with Wordly, you need a basic knowledge of Ruby on Rails, the underlying framework on which Wordly is built. The
rest should be a pretty easy ride from there, as Wordly uses publicly available tools, like ActiveAdmin or Twitter Bootstrap to
magically drive your blog into fame and fortune.
